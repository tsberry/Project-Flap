Project Flap (AKA FLAPPY SAT)

Since the rise of smartphones, video games playable on iPhone and Android have become extremely popular, with many of these games going viral. One of the most recent of 
these was Flappy Bird, a deceptively simple game in which you control a bird who can only fly up and drop down while avoiding pipes rising from the bottom and dropping 
from the top of the screen. With just one simple control (touch to go up, release to go down), it is not difficult to see why Flappy Bird became extremely popular 
extremely quickly – it was apparently making its creator $50,000 a day at its peak.However, Flappy Bird's life at the top was short-lived, as its creator removed it 
from the app stores shortly after it went viral (for unclear reasons).Since Flappy Bird went viral, many similar games have popped up on the Apple and Android app 
stores, attempting to capitalize on the craze, as well as on the void left by the game's removal from the app store. Indeed, Flappy Bird itself was not even the 
original Flappy Bird – an extremely similar flash game (the ubiquitous Helicopter game) has been available on the internet for at least ten years. With this 
popularity in mind, we have decided to develop our own take on the Flappy Bird craze – FLAPPY SAT!

Controls: Press Space to flap (that's it)

To run: the repository contains 3 zipped files (1 for mac, 1 for windows, and 1 for linux). You can download and unzip one of these files and simply run
the run executable file. However (while this is clearly the correct way to do it), the mac zip file seems to be broken, as it is missing its executable file.

Alternatively, you could (with sbt installed) simply clone this project and do $sbt run from the command line (from within the project directory).
