Project Flap (AKA FLAPPY SAT)

Flappy Sat has now been completed! Featuring the same great gameplay you know and love, the game now features a menu as well as the ability to restart the game.
Additionally, it now tracks your high scores (don't cheat :) ). Perhaps most excitingly of all, you can now unlock additional characters to play as by getting
new high scores. You already loved Sat, but can you unlock the game's three SECRET CHARACTERS? Good luck!

To compile Flappy Sat from source code:
You will need:
1. sbt (http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
2. sbt-scage-plugin (https://github.com/mvallerie/sbt-scage-plugin)

Once you have installed sbt and the scage plugin, clone/pull the repository. Navigate in terminal to the folder where the code is stored (the parent folder i.e.
the one with the src, target, etc. folders inside) and type "sbt compile" to compile or "sbt run" to run (running will compile automatically).
