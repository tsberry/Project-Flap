To create a runnable offline distribution type in console:

  $ mvn clean package -Pbuild

Or just

  $ mvn clean package

as the "build" profile is default one. Add "-Dmaven.test.skip" if you want to skip tests.

The distribution will be created in the "target" folder. It will be folder or zip-archive - depends on the "install.type" setting in
the "build.properties" file.

To build the project for distribution via Java Web Start type in console:

  $ mvn clean package -Pwebstart

The distribution will be created in the "target/jnlp" folder. Copy this folder to your server where your website situated.

You need to fill the "url" tag in pom.xml with the correct website url:
<url>http://example.com</url>

During the build process all jar-files must be signed. For that purpose you need to create certificate and pass it to the builder using
this properties in the "build.properties" or "local-build.properties" which is preferred:

  keystore = /path/to/keystore
  keystore.alias = my_keystore
  keystore.pass = mypassword
  key.pass = mypassword

To create new certificate type in command prompt:

  $ keytool -genkey -keystore my_keystore -alias my_keystore

Keytool is a part of jdk. The program will ask your to specifiy several parameters including passwords. The file "my_keystore" will be
created in your current directory.

For security reasons please use the "local-build.properties" file to store that data and add this file to .gitignore so it won't be
commited to public repositories.
